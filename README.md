E

First and foremost the assets used in this game are not made by me, they belong to the alias Pixel Frog. The assets are free but I thought I would credit and make sure to leave the link here as well: https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/pixel-adventure-1. 

E is meant to be a 2D platformer that focuses on a pressured playing experience. As the player progresses there is the introduction of mud which rises while the player travles upwards past obstacles to collect a trohpy which is at the end of each level. The game doesn't have everything I would like for it to have in terms of the variety of hazards and a better playing experience, but the functionality is all there for further expansion. 

E is made using the combination of Unity and C#. The game's terrain is made using Unity's tilemap feature which contains four different layers: background, foreground, hazards, and mud. The game allows the main player to double jump but in return the inability to wall jump along with pickups the player can collect for points. The player is also allowed three lives in total, if the player dies in that specific level they start over at that level. Levels that contain pickups will also remember which pickups were picked up by the player, so if the player dies they don't have to recollect them. With pickups being explained, this concludes the majority of the game's functionality. 

If you would like to see screenshots of the game they will be provided in this repository.
